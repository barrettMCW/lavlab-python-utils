## How to Contribute

If you have never contributed to a project before there is a great guide from the folks at Github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).
Beyond that just be sure to document your code with docstrings and add tests as needed.
